# My RSS Feeds

I'm very happy to share my RSS-Feeds in OPML format.

So, feel free to plug in on my sources of information. I'm still tidying up my feeds after my TinyTiny-RSS aggregator crashed on me.

## Security, non-security, education

For my dayjob, I'm a teacher. So security, insecurity, nonsecurity, politics combined with educational resources can be found here.

## Updates

When needed. When you feel I need to update it, ping me.
